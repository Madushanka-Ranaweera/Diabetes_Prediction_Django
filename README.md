# Diabetes_Prediction_Django
Diabetes prediction module made using machine learning concepts and deployed it using Django
# Python Diabetes Prediction
## The packeges used:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- seaborn
## For get the best predictions, I have check some several machine learing modeles:
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

### According to the results, the best ML model is random forest it give nearly 74% accuracy.
